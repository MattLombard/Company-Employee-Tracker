# Company Employee Tracker

## Description

This is a command-line application that allows users to manage employee data in a MySQL database. The application provides a number of options, including the ability to view all departments, roles, and employees, as well as add new departments, roles, and employees, and update an employee's role.

To use the application, users must have Node.js and MySQL installed on their computers. After cloning the repository, users should run npm install to install the required dependencies. They should then create a MySQL database using the schema and seed files provided in the db folder. The database configuration details in the server.js file should also be updated to match the user's MySQL setup.

Once the database is set up, users can run the application by running the node server.js command in their terminal. They will be presented with a list of options, which they can select using the arrow keys and Enter key. Based on the selected option, the application will query the database and display the appropriate data or prompt the user to enter new data.
